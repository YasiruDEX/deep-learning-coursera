Question 1

To help you practice strategies for machine learning, this week we’ll present another scenario and ask how you would act. We think this “simulator” of working in a machine learning project will give an idea of what leading a machine learning project could be like!

You are employed by a startup building self-driving cars. You are in charge of detecting road signs (stop sign, pedestrian crossing sign, construction ahead sign) and traffic signals (red and green lights) in images. The goal is to recognize which of these objects appear in each image. As an example, this image contains a pedestrian crossing sign and red traffic lights.

Your 100,000 labeled images are taken using the front-facing camera of your car. This is also the distribution of data you care most about doing well on. You think you might be able to get a much larger dataset off the internet, which could be helpful for training even if the distribution of internet data is not the same.

You are getting started with this project. What is the first thing you do? Assume each of the steps below would take about an equal amount of time (a few days).

1 / 1 point

Expand

Correct

Applied ML is highly iterative. Having a basic model to do an error analysis can point you in the most promising directions with a lot of certainties.


      2.

Question 2

Your goal is to detect road signs (stop sign, pedestrian crossing sign, construction ahead sign) and traffic signals (red and green lights) in images. The goal is to recognize which of these objects appear in each image. You plan to use a deep neural network with ReLU units in the hidden layers.  For the output layer, a softmax activation would be a good choice for the output layer because this is a multi-task learning problem. True/False?

1 / 1 point

Expand

Correct

Softmax would be a good choice if one and only one of the possibilities (stop sign, speed bump, pedestrian crossing, green light and red light) was present in each image.


      3.

Question 3

When trying to determine what strategy to implement to improve the performance of a model, we manually check all images of the training set where the algorithm was successful. True/False?

1 / 1 point

Expand

Correct

Correct. This set should be too large to manually check all the images. It is better to focus on the images that the algorithm got wrong from the dev set. Also, choose a large enough subset that we can manually check.


      4.

Question 4

After working on the data for several weeks, your team ends up with the following data:

  *

    100,000 labeled images taken using the front-facing camera of your car.

  *

    900,000 labeled images of roads downloaded from the internet.

  *

    Each image’s labels precisely indicate the presence of any specific road signs and traffic signals or combinations of them. For example, y(i)=[10010]y^{(i)} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}y(i)=⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎡​10010​⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎤​ means the image contains a stop sign and a red traffic light.

When using a non fully labeled image such as y(i)=[0?1?1]y^{(i)} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ \text{?} \\ 1 \\ \text{?} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}y(i)=⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎡​0?1?1​⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎤​, which of the following strategies is most appropriate to calculate the loss function to train as a multi-task learning problem?

1 / 1 point

Expand

Correct

Correct. We can't use the components of the labels that are missing but we can use the ones we have to train the model.


      5.

Question 5

The distribution of data you care about contains images from your car’s front-facing camera; which comes from a different distribution than the images you were able to find and download off the internet. How should you split the dataset into train/dev/test sets?

1 / 1 point

Expand

Correct

Yes. As seen in the lecture, it is important that your dev and test set have the closest possible distribution to “real” data. It is also important for the training set to contain enough “real” data to avoid having a data-mismatch problem.


      6.

Question 6

Assume you’ve finally chosen the following split between of the data:

*Dataset:*

	

*Contains:*

	

*Error of the algorithm:*

Training

	

940,000 images randomly picked from (900,000 internet images + 60,000 car’s front-facing camera images)

	

8.8%

Training-Dev

	

20,000 images randomly picked from (900,000 internet images + 60,000 car’s front-facing camera images)

	

9.1%

Dev

	

20,000 images from your car’s front-facing camera

	

14.3%

Test

	

20,000 images from the car’s front-facing camera

	

14.8%

You also know that human-level error on the road sign and traffic signals classification task is around 0.5%. Which of the following are True? (Check all that apply).

1 / 1 point

Expand

Correct

Great, you got all the right answers.


      7.

Question 7

Assume you’ve finally chosen the following split between the data:

*Dataset:*

	

*Contains:*

	

*Error of the algorithm:*

Training

	

940,000 images randomly picked from (900,000 internet images + 60,000 car’s front-facing camera images)

	

2%

Training-Dev

	

20,000 images randomly picked from (900,000 internet images + 60,000 car’s front-facing camera images)

	

2.3%

Dev

	

20,000 images from your car’s front-facing camera

	

1.3%

Test

	

20,000 images from the car’s front-facing camera

	

1.1%

You also know that human-level error on the road sign and traffic signals classification task is around 0.5%. Based on the information given, a friend thinks that the training data distribution is much harder than the dev/test distribution. What do you think?

0 / 1 point

Expand

Incorrect

Notice that the test and dev errors are lower than the train and train-dev errors.


      8.

Question 8

You decide to focus on the dev set and check by hand what the errors are due to. Here is a table summarizing your discoveries: 

Overall dev set error

	

15.3%

Errors due to incorrectly labeled data

	

4.1% 

Errors due to foggy pictures

	

3.0%

Errors due to partially occluded elements.

	

7.2%

Errors due to other causes

	

1.0%

In this table, 4.1%, 7.2%, etc. are a fraction of the total dev set (not just examples of your algorithm mislabeled). For example, about 7.2/15.3 = 47% of your errors are due to partially occluded elements.

You shouldn't invest all your efforts to get more images with partially occluded elements since 4.1 + 3.0 + 1.0 = 8.1 > 7.2. True/False?

1 / 1 point

Expand

Correct

Correct. These kinds of arguments don't help us to decide on the strategy to follow. Other factors should be used, such as the tradeoff between the cost of getting new images and the improvement of the system performance.


      9.

Question 9

You decide to focus on the dev set and check by hand what the errors are due to. Here is a table summarizing your discoveries: 

Overall dev set error

	

15.3%

Errors due to incorrectly labeled data

	

4.1% 

Errors due to foggy pictures

	

3.0%

Errors due to partially occluded elements.

	

7.2%

Errors due to other causes

	

1.0%

In this table, 4.1%, 7.2%, etc. are a fraction of the total dev set (not just examples of your algorithm mislabeled). For example, about 7.2/15.3 = 47% of your errors are due to partially occluded elements.

You find out that there is an anti-reflective film guarantee to eliminate the sun reflection, but it is quite costly. Which of the following gives the best description of what the investment in the film can do to the model?

1 / 1 point

Expand

Correct

Yes. Remember that this 7.2% gives us an estimate for the ceiling of how much the error can be reduced when the cause is fixed.


      10.

Question 10

You decide to use data augmentation to address foggy images. You find 1,000 pictures of fog off the internet, and “add” them to clean images to synthesize foggy days, like this:

Which of the following do you agree with?

1 / 1 point

Expand

Correct

Yes. The synthetic data can help to train the model to get better performance at the dev set, but shouldn't be added to the dev or test sets because they don't represent our target in a completely accurate way.


      11.

Question 11

After working further on the problem, you've decided to correct the incorrectly labeled data. Your team corrects the labels of the wrongly predicted images on the dev set. Which of the following is a necessary step to take?

1 / 1 point

Expand

Correct

Correct. Recall that the dev set and the test set must come from the same distribution.


      12.

Question 12

Your client asks you to add the capability to detect dogs that may be crossing the road to the system. He can provide a relatively small set containing dogs. Which of the following do you agree most with?

1 / 1 point

Expand

Correct

Correct. Since your model has learned useful low-level features to tackle the new task we can conserve those by using the pre-trained weights.


      13.

Question 13

One of your colleagues at the startup is starting a project to classify road signs as stop, dangerous curve, construction ahead, dead-end, and speed limit signs. He has approximately 30,000 examples of each image and 30,000 images without a sign. This case could benefit from using multi-task learning. True/False?

1 / 1 point

Expand

Correct

Correct. There are a lot of high-level features that all the required signs share. This is a great scenario to make use of multi-task learning.


      14.

Question 14

To recognize red and green lights, you have been using this approach:

  *

    *(A)* Input an image (x) to a neural network and have it directly learn a mapping to make a prediction as to whether there’s a red light and/or green light (y).

A teammate proposes a different, two-step approach:

  *

    *(B)* In this two-step approach, you would first (i) detect the traffic light in the image (if any), then (ii) determine the color of the illuminated lamp in the traffic light. 

Between these two, Approach B is more of an end-to-end approach because it has distinct steps for the input end and the output end. True/False? 

1 / 1 point

Expand

Correct

Yes. (A) is an end-to-end approach as it maps directly the input (x) to the output (y).


      15.

Question 15

An end-to-end approach doesn't require that we hand-design useful features, it only requires a large enough model. True/False?

1 / 1 point

Expand

Correct

Correct. This is one of the major characteristics of deep learning models, that we don't need to hand-design the features.
